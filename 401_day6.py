#In Python, create a script that utilizes the cryptography library to:

#Prompt the user to select a mode:
    #Encrypt a file (mode 1)
    #Decrypt a file (mode 2)
    #Encrypt a message (mode 3)
    #Decrypt a message (mode 4)
#If mode 1 or 2 are selected, prompt the user to provide a filepath to a target file.
#If mode 3 or 4 are selected, prompt the user to provide a cleartext string.
#Depending on the selection, perform one of the below functions. Youâ€™ll need to create four functions:
    #Encrypt the target file if in mode 1.
        #Delete the existing target file and replace it entirely with the encrypted version.
    #Decrypt the target file if in mode 2.
        #Delete the encrypted target file and replace it entirely with the decrypted version.
#Encrypt the string if in mode 3.
#Print the ciphertext to the screen.
#Decrypt the string if in mode 4.
#Print the cleartext to the screen.
